## To do 🚌
- student.addindex().etc should be void // Done changing @ class diagram, required ChiaZhe to change his code **Bryson
- should create student pwd be invisible?🤔 // I think no need to be invisible **Bryson
- get index number // get course name?
- line 108 @ MySTARS.java, shouldn't mode == 1 be logging into admin instead of students? （ ✅ DONE BY JIA WEN)
- Shouldn't Student class be extending User class?? （ ✅ DONE BY JIA WEN)
